# About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This is a repository for holding my practicing code and demos of tiny games using C++. 

Why am I doing this:
* I would like to build up my portfolio to stand out, I have some games made already and I want to create some tiny demos on my own. ðŸŽ²
* I'd also like to know more about the basic of a game engine, which includes graphics and physics. ðŸ“–
* I just want to create some games in my own pace. I found game jams are fun (I already did some) but I want to have something done w/o having an actual due date. ðŸ˜„

As you can see, this will be a ongoing project and will grow continusly as I learn more.
